/**
 * Active Inference Module for Deep Tree Echo
 *
 * This module implements the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference
 * framework, enabling Deep Tree Echo to engage in predictive processing,
 * belief updating, and niche construction.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Free Energy Minimization: Reducing prediction error through perception and action
 * - Active Inference: Selecting actions that minimize expected free energy
 * - Niche Construction: Shaping the environment to support future cognition
 *
 * Based on theoretical neuroscience work by Karl Friston and colleagues.
