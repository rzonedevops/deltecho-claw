# Build Troubleshooting Report: deltecho-chat

This report details the process of diagnosing and resolving the CI/CD build failures for the `deltecho-chat` project. The `build-troubleshooter` skill was used to analyze the build logs, identify the root causes of the failures, and apply the necessary fixes.

## 1. Initial Build Failures

The initial analysis of the build logs revealed multiple failures across different platforms and build targets. The following table summarizes the initial status of the builds:

| Build Target              | Platform       | Status      |
| :------------------------ | :------------- | :---------- |
| Build Browser             | ubuntu-latest  | ✅ Success  |
| Build Core & Orchestrator | ubuntu-latest  | ✅ Success  |
| Electron                  | windows-latest | ❌ Failure  |
| Electron                  | ubuntu-latest  | ❌ Canceled |
| Electron                  | macos-latest   | ❌ Canceled |
| Tauri                     | ubuntu-22.04   | ❌ Failure  |
| Tauri                     | windows-latest | ❌ Failure  |
| Tauri                     | macos-latest   | ❌ Failure  |

## 2. Root Cause Analysis and Fixes

A detailed analysis of the build logs identified several root causes for the failures. The following sections describe the issues and the fixes that were implemented.

### 2.1. Tauri Build Failures

#### 2.1.1. Ubuntu Dependency Issues

- **Issue:** The Tauri build on Ubuntu 22.04 failed due to missing `webkit2gtk-4.1` and `javascriptcoregtk-4.1` dependencies. The build was attempting to use version `4.0`, which is not available on Ubuntu 22.04.
- **Fix:** The `release.yml` workflow was updated to install the correct versions of the WebKitGTK and JavaScriptCoreGTK development libraries for Ubuntu 22.04. Additionally, `libsoup-3.0-dev` was added as a required dependency.

#### 2.1.2. Version Mismatch in `tauri-plugin-dialog`

- **Issue:** The Tauri builds for macOS and Windows failed due to a version mismatch between the `tauri-plugin-dialog` Rust crate and the corresponding NPM package.
- **Fix:** The `package.json` file in the `packages/target-tauri` directory was updated to align the version of the `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` NPM package with the version of the Rust crate.

#### 2.1.3. `git describe` Failure

- **Issue:** The Tauri builds failed because the `git describe` command, used to generate version information, was unable to find any git tags in the repository.
- **Fix:** The `release.yml` workflow was updated to set the `VERSION_INFO_GIT_REF` environment variable to the current `github.sha`. This provides the build script with the necessary version information without relying on git tags.

### 2.2. Electron Build Failures

#### 2.2.1. Windows Build Issues

- **Issue:** The Electron build on Windows failed for two reasons:
  1.  The `electron-builder` was attempting to execute `pnpm.cjs` directly, which is not a valid Win32 application.
  2.  The `--project` flag was causing an incorrect path to be used for the `electron-builder.json5` configuration file.
- **Fix:** The `release.yml` workflow was updated to:
  1.  Use `npx electron-builder` to invoke the builder directly.
  2.  Change the working directory to `packages/target-electron` before running the build command, removing the need for the `--project` flag.

#### 2.2.2. macOS Code Signing

- **Issue:** The Electron build on macOS was failing due to code signing errors. This is expected as the build environment does not have access to the required Apple Developer certificates.
- **Fix:** The `release.yml` workflow was updated to skip code signing and notarization for macOS builds. The build target was changed to `zip` to create an unsigned application bundle.

### 2.3. ESLint Configuration

- **Issue:** The frontend build was failing due to an ESLint configuration issue. The build script was using a legacy ESLint API that was not compatible with the flat config (`eslint.config.js`) used in the project.
- **Fix:** The frontend package was updated to use the root ESLint 9.x dependency, and the build script was modified to correctly resolve the flat config from the project root.

## 3. Final Build Status

After applying all the fixes and removing the macOS builds as requested, the CI/CD workflows were triggered again. All builds for the remaining platforms (Linux and Windows) have passed successfully.

| Build Target              | Platform       | Status     |
| :------------------------ | :------------- | :--------- |
| Build Browser             | ubuntu-latest  | ✅ Success |
| Build Core & Orchestrator | ubuntu-latest  | ✅ Success |
| Electron                  | ubuntu-latest  | ✅ Success |
| Electron                  | windows-latest | ✅ Success |
| Tauri                     | ubuntu-22.04   | ✅ Success |
| Tauri                     | windows-latest | ✅ Success |

## 4. Conclusion

The CI/CD build failures for the `deltecho-chat` project have been successfully diagnosed and resolved. The build pipeline is now stable for the Linux and Windows platforms.
